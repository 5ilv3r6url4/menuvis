# menuVis

Cost-benefit analysis tool for chefs, scraping ingredient prices from suppliers. It
visualizes data across various levels, including price tracking, recipe creation,
volatility, and management. The tool received positive feedback from user studies. The codebase was
built using Qt for the GUI and data visuals. My roles were lead developer and business research recruiter.

## ABSTRACT
We present menuVis, a recipe creation tool that helps visualize and
analyze food cost for chefs. We collected two user requirements:
(1) creating and adjusting recipes, and (2) monitoring the volatility
of ingredient cost. Based on these two requirements, we provide
visualization solutions and embed them into chefs work flow.
